* The codes run under CMSSW_12_1_0
* To run, compile using "g++ histo.C -o hist `root-config --cflags --glibs`", then "./hist"

N.B. 
* i didn't find a good way to read json in cpp code (please update it if you know how to), so i wrote all the MC processes by hand
* thes code will output root files of all the processes, then they will be used for plot
* ~3mins for one kinematic (stable)
